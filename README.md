# Fit text

A simple script to downsize any text to fit on 1 line within its container (within limits).

## Use case

Likely the only use case for this is when your content is translated. You may have a CTA or a title where you prefer (or need) the text to be on 1 line if possible, but the text content varies with each translation, and the translations are subject to change.
